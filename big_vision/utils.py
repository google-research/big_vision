def pad_shard_unpad(wrapped, static_argnums=(0,), static_argnames=()):
  """Wraps a function with code that pads, shards, then un-shards, un-pads.

  Args:
    wrapped: the function to be wrapped. Signature is `params, *args, *kwargs`.
    static_argnums: indices of arguments to `wrapped` that should _not_ be
      padded and sharded, but instead be forwarded as-is. The default is (0,)
      because by far the most common use-case is to pass `params` first.
    static_argnames: names of kwargs to `wrapped` that should _not_ be padded
      and sharded, but instead be forwarded as-is.

  Returns:
    A new function that pads and shards its arguments before passing them to
    the wrapped function, and un-shards and un-pads the returned pytree.

    This is useful for calling a pmap'ed function with inputs that aren't
    divisible by the number of devices. A typical use is:
      @pad_shard_unpad
      @jax.pmap
      def forward(params, x): ...

  Notes:
    The padding is done in host-memory before being passed to the function, and
    the values returned by the function are transferred back to host memory.

    The returned function is augmented with a new keyword-only argument
    `min_device_batch` that, if specified, forces padding inputs to at least
    this size per device. This can be useful to avoid recompiles for the last
    batch and reduce memory fragmentation.
