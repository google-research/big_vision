"""Evaluator for the contrastive task.

DON'T COMPARE ACROSS RUNS, use for training health monitoring only.

Note that this evaluator's `ncorrect_minibatch` is only a rough proxy for
training progress and does not report the actual `ncorrect`: when the same
labels found multiple times in a batch, then the reported value is biased
towards lower values.

Also note that the `ncorrect_minibatch` is a function of batch size (it's a lot
easier to find correct values in small batches).
