  """Transform an input string into the preprocessing function.

  The minilanguage is as follows:

    fn1|fn2(arg, arg2,...)|...

  And describes the successive application of the various `fn`s to the input,
  where each function can optionally have one or more arguments, which are
  either positional or key/value, as dictated by the `fn`.

  The output preprocessing function expects a dictionary as input. This
  dictionary should have a key "image" that corresponds to a 3D tensor
  (height x width x channel).

  Args:
    pp_pipeline: A string describing the pre-processing pipeline. If empty or
      None, no preprocessing will be executed.
    log_data: Whether to log the data before and after preprocessing. Note:
      Remember set to `False` in eager mode to avoid too many log messages.

  Returns:
    preprocessing function.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if preprocessing function name is unknown
