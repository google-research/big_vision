# Big Vision

This codebase is designed for training large-scale vision models using
[Cloud TPU VMs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-cloud-tpu-vms)
or GPU machines. It is based on [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax)/[Flax](https://github.com/google/flax)
libraries, and uses [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data) and
[TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets) for scalable and
reproducible input pipelines.

The open-sourcing of this codebase has two main purposes:
1. Publishing the code of research projects developed in this codebase (see a
   list below).
2. Providing a strong starting point for running large-scale vision experiments
   on GPU machines and Google Cloud TPUs, which should scale seamlessly and
   out-of-the box from a single TPU core to a distributed setup with up to 2048
   TPU cores.

`big_vision` aims to support research projects at Google. We are unlikely to
work on feature requests or accept external contributions, unless they were
pre-approved (ask in an issue first). For a well-supported transfer-only
codebase, see also [vision_transformer](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer).

The following research projects were originally conducted in the `big_vision`
codebase:

# Codebase high-level organization and principles in a nutshell

The main entry point is a trainer module, which typically does all the
boilerplate related to creating a model and an optimizer, loading the data,
checkpointing and training/evaluating the model inside a loop. We provide the
canonical trainer `train.py` in the root folder. Normally, individual projects
within `big_vision` fork and customize this trainer.

All models, evaluators and preprocessing operations live in the corresponding
subdirectories and can often be reused between different projects. We encourage
compatible APIs within these directories to facilitate reusability, but it is
not strictly enforced, as individual projects may need to introduce their custom
APIs.

We have a powerful configuration system, with the configs living in the
`configs/` directory. Custom trainers and modules can directly extend/modify
the configuration options.

Training jobs are robust to interruptions and will resume seamlessly from the
last saved checkpoint (assuming a user provides the correct `--workdir` path).

Each configuration file contains a comment at the top with a `COMMAND` snippet
to run it, and some hint of expected runtime and results. See below for more
details, but generally speaking, running on a GPU machine involves calling
`python -m COMMAND` while running on TPUs, including multi-host, involves

```
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $NAME --zone=$ZONE --worker=all
  --command "bash big_vision/run_tpu.sh COMMAND"
```

See instructions below for more details on how to run `big_vision` code on a
GPU machine or Google Cloud TPU.

By default we write checkpoints and logfiles. The logfiles are a list of JSON
objects, and we provide a short and straightforward [example colab to read
and display the logs and checkpoints](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R_lvV542WUp8Q2y8sbyooZOGCplkn7KI?usp=sharing).

# Current and future contents

The first release contains the core part of pre-training, transferring, and
evaluating classification models at scale on Cloud TPU VMs.

We have since added the following key features and projects:
- Contrastive Image-Text model training and evaluation as in LiT and CLIP.
- Patient and consistent distillation.
- Scaling ViT.
- MLP-Mixer.
- UViM.

Features and projects we plan to release in the near future, in no particular
order:
- ImageNet-21k in TFDS.
- Loading misc public models used in our publications (NFNet, MoCov3, DINO).
- Memory-efficient Polyak-averaging implementation.
- Advanced JAX compute and memory profiling. We are using internal tools for
    this, but may eventually add support for the publicly available ones.

We will continue releasing code of our future publications developed within
`big_vision` here.

### Non-content

The following exist in the internal variant of this codebase, and there is no
plan for their release:
- Regular regression tests for both quality and speed. They rely heavily on
    internal infrastructure.
- Advanced logging, monitoring, and plotting of experiments. This also relies
    heavily on internal infrastructure. However, we are open to ideas on this
    and may add some in the future, especially if implemented in a
    self-contained manner.
- Not yet published, ongoing research projects.


# GPU Setup

We first discuss how to setup and run `big_vision` on a (local) GPU machine,
and then discuss the setup for Cloud TPUs. Note that data preparation step for
(local) GPU setup can be largely reused for the Cloud TPU setup. While the
instructions skip this for brevity, we highly recommend using a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) when
installing python dependencies.

## Setting up python packages

The first step is to checkout `big_vision` and install relevant python
dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/google-research/big_vision
cd big_vision/
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r big_vision/requirements.txt
```

The latest version of `jax` library can be fetched as

```
pip3 install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

You may need a different `jax` package, depending on CUDA and cuDNN libraries
installed on your machine. Please consult
[official jax documentation](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-gpu-cuda)
for more information.

## Preparing tfds data

For unified and reproducible access to standard datasets we opted to use the
`tensorflow_datasets` (`tfds`) library. It requires each dataset to be
downloaded, preprocessed and then to be stored on a hard drive (or, if you use
"Google Cloud", preferably stored in a "GCP bucket".).

Many datasets can be downloaded and preprocessed automatically when used
for the first time. Nevertheless, we intentionally disable this feature and
recommend doing dataset preparation step separately, ahead of the first run. It
will make debugging easier if problems arise and some datasets, like
`imagenet2012`, require manually downloaded data.

Most of the datasets, e.g. `cifar100`, `oxford_iiit_pet` or `imagenet_v2`
can be fully automatically downloaded and prepared by running

```
cd big_vision/
python3 -m big_vision.tools.download_tfds_datasets cifar100 oxford_iiit_pet imagenet_v2
```

A full list of datasets is available at [this link](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview#all_datasets).

Some datasets, like `imagenet2012` or `imagenet2012_real`, require the data to
be downloaded manually and placed into `$TFDS_DATA_DIR/downloads/manual/`,
which defaults to `~/tensorflow_datasets/downloads/manual/`. For example, for
`imagenet2012` and `imagenet2012_real` one needs to place the official
`ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar` and `ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar` files in that directory
and then run
`python3 -m big_vision.tools.download_tfds_datasets imagenet2012 imagenet2012_real`
(which may take ~1 hour).

If you use `Google Cloud` and, TPUs in particular, you can then upload
the preprocessed data (stored in `$TFDS_DATA_DIR`) to
"Google Cloud Bucket" and use the bucket on any of your (TPU) virtual
machines to access the data.

## Running on a GPU machine

Finally, after installing all python dependencies and preparing `tfds` data,
the user can run the job using config of their choice, e.g. to train `ViT-S/16`
model on ImageNet data, one should run the following command:

```
python3 -m big_vision.train --config big_vision/configs/vit_s16_i1k.py --workdir workdirs/`date '+%m-%d_%H%M'`
```

or to train MLP-Mixer-B/16, run (note the `gpu8` config param that reduces the default batch size and epoch count):

```
python3 -m big_vision.train --config big_vision/configs/mlp_mixer_i1k.py:gpu8 --workdir workdirs/`date '+%m-%d_%H%M'`
```

# Cloud TPU VM setup

## Create TPU VMs

To create a single machine with 8 TPU cores, follow the following Cloud TPU JAX
document:
https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/run-calculation-jax

To support large-scale vision research, more cores with multiple hosts are
recommended. Below we provide instructions on how to do it.

First, create some useful variables, which we be reused:

```
export NAME="a name of the TPU deployment, e.g. my-tpu-machine"
export ZONE="GCP geographical zone, e.g. europe-west4-a"
export GS_BUCKET_NAME="Name of the storage bucket, e.g. my_bucket"
```

The following command line will create TPU VMs with 32 cores,
4 hosts.

```
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm create $NAME --zone $ZONE --accelerator-type v3-32 --version v2-tf-stable
```

## Install `big_vision` on TPU VMs

Fetch the `big_vision` repository, copy it to all TPU VM hosts, and install
dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/google-research/big_vision
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm scp --recurse big_vision/big_vision $NAME: --zone=$ZONE --worker=all
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $NAME --zone=$ZONE --worker=all --command "bash big_vision/run_tpu.sh"
```

## Download and prepare TFDS datasets

We recommend preparing `tfds` data locally as described above and then uploading
the data to `Google Cloud` bucket. However, if you prefer, the datasets which
do not require manual downloads can be prepared automatically using a TPU
machine as described below.

Specifically, the seven TFDS datasets used during evaluations will be generated
under `~/tensorflow_datasets` on TPU machine with this command:

```
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $NAME --zone=$ZONE --worker=0 --command "bash big_vision/run_tpu.sh big_vision.tools.download_tfds_datasets cifar10 cifar100 oxford_iiit_pet oxford_flowers102 cars196 dtd uc_merced"
```

You can then copy the datasets to GS bucket, to make them accessible to all TPU workers.

```
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $NAME --zone=$ZONE --worker=0 --command "rm -r ~/tensorflow_datasets/downloads && gsutil cp -r ~/tensorflow_datasets gs://$GS_BUCKET_NAME"
```

If you want to integrate other public or custom datasets, i.e. imagenet2012,
please follow [the official guideline](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview).

## Pre-trained models

For the full list of pre-trained models check out the `load` function defined in
the same module as the model code. And for example config on how to use these
models, see `configs/transfer.py`.

## Run the transfer script on TPU VMs

The following command line fine-tunes a pre-trained `vit-i21k-augreg-b/32` model
on `cifar10` dataset.

```
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $NAME --zone=$ZONE --worker=all --command "TFDS_DATA_DIR=gs://$GS_BUCKET_NAME/tensorflow_datasets bash big_vision/run_tpu.sh big_vision.train --config big_vision/configs/transfer.py:model=vit-i21k-augreg-b/32,dataset=cifar10,crop=resmall_crop --workdir gs://$GS_BUCKET_NAME/big_vision/workdir/`date '+%m-%d_%H%M'` --config.lr=0.03"
```

## Run the train script on TPU VMs

To train your own big_vision models on a large dataset,
e.g. `imagenet2012` ([prepare the TFDS dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenet2012)),
run the following command line.

```
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $NAME --zone=$ZONE --worker=all --command "TFDS_DATA_DIR=gs://$GS_BUCKET_NAME/tensorflow_datasets bash big_vision/run_tpu.sh big_vision.train --config big_vision/configs/bit_i1k.py  --workdir gs://$GS_BUCKET_NAME/big_vision/workdir/`date '+%m-%d_%H%M'`"
```

## Sometimes useful gcloud commands

- Destroy the TPU machines: `gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm delete $NAME --zone $ZONE`
- Remove all big_vision-related folders on all hosts: `gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $NAME --zone $ZONE --worker=all --command 'rm -rf ~/big_vision ~/bv_venv'`

# ViT baseline

We provide a well-tuned ViT-S/16 baseline in the config file named
`vit_s16_i1k.py`. It achieves 76.5% accuracy on ImageNet validation split in
90 epochs of training, being a strong and simple starting point for research
on the ViT models.
