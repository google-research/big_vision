# How to Contribute

At this time we do not plan to accept non-trivial contributions. The main
purpose of this codebase is to allow the community to reproduce results from our
publications.

You are however free to start a fork of the project for your purposes as
permitted by the license.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
